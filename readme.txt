First Version of a Finite Element Method code for a beam (or rather, a 2D rectangle structure, if you want to be more generic) clamped on both ends.
Able to switch between Plane Stress or Plane Strain.
There's a single concentrated load acting on top of the beam.
Able to switch between linear and quadratic elements (cubic or quarternary elements not implemented yet).
